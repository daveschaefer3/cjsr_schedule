CJSR Schedule
=============

An online schedule for CJSR 88.5FM, Alberta, Canada's first campus radio station.

This schedule is generated within the browser every time the page is visited.
All show data is currently kept in a flat file (showJson.js) in JSON notation.
This data is processed by schedule.js and is used to fill Handlebars.js string templates, located in index.php.
These string templates are styled using Less, a dynamic stylesheet language, and Twitter Bootstrap.

Click on any show to see more information about a show.

Future features will hopefully include:
  - a responsive design for mobile and widescreen browsers
  - a re-organization of the codebase using Angular or some other framework
  - a back-end for administration (CRUD functions) using MongoDB and node.js
  - support for Internet Explorer
  - various tooltips and widgets (what's on now, genre legend), twitter integration/handles

Please get in touch if you see any problems and would like to help!
